# Nasa Testing Ground
A website that hooks into Nasa's official API portal to display some galactic fun.
[Website](https://rainbow-muffin-38c867.netlify.app/)
## Origin
This project is a revisit and refactoring of a similar project that I was working on. The difference, now, is that I have learned new skills and tools which I would like to bundle and apply to this new version.
### Tech
HTML, CSS, JS.
React⚛, (React Router🔀, Icons❎ ), Tailwind CSS💨, Axios📲, Framer Motion🎬
### Interaction
The website loads with Nasa's Astronomy Picture of the Day, and you can navigate to the 'New Date' page to fetch your own 'APOD' with a custom date starting from the year 1995, which is the year Nasa began their stream. 📅.

### Notes
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
