# Nasa Testing Ground
A website that hooks into Nasa's official API portal to display some galactic fun.
## Origin
This project is a revisit and refactoring of a similar project that I was working on. The difference, now, is that I have learned new skills and tools which I would like to bundle and apply to this new version. This is an on-going project that I hope to improve upon in the future. 
### Status
This will be a work in progress while I'm in school.
### Demo
### Tech
HTML, CSS, JS.
React, (React Router, Icons ), Tailwind CSS, Axios
### Roadmap
I would like to include other sections of Nasa's API page, and improve styling, structure, and overall functionality. 
### Interaction
The website loads with Nasa's Astronomy Picture of the Day, and you can navigate to the 'New Date' page to fetch your own 'APOD' with a custom date ranging the last 50 years. 

### Notes
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
